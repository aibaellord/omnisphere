- **Rate limiting** with configurable delays between requests
- **Error handling** for network issues, API limits, and invalid responses

### 🎛️ Professional CLI Interface
```bash
# Test API connections
python assets_fetcher.py --test-apis

# Check quota usage across all providers
python assets_fetcher.py --list-quota

# Process script files
python assets_fetcher.py --script-file data/scripts/your-script.md

# Direct text processing
python assets_fetcher.py --text "Your video script content here"
```

### 🔄 Python API Integration
```python
from assets_fetcher import AssetsFetcher

# Initialize with API keys
fetcher = AssetsFetcher(
    pexels_api_key="your-key",
    unsplash_access_key="your-key",
    pixabay_api_key="your-key"
)

# Process script sentences asynchronously
results = await fetcher.process_script_sentences(sentences)
```
